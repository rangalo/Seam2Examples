These are 2 the examples of the book
http://www.packtpub.com/seam-2-x-web-development

These 2 are basic seam examples with ejbs.

The third one is Open16 from Seam In Action book.
It is a bit involved example uses many other things like 
facelets, persistence etc.


I have tried to mavenise the examples
